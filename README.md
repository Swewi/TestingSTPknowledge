# Test Your Sir Terry Pratchett Knowledge

This is a small website with limited question options, however I intend to expand it as I learn about API's to source greater pools of questions.

The purpose of this website is to have some fun while testing your STP knowledge, using a randomiser to pick x-questions from a pool of y-questions.  At the same time not repeating any questions from the question pool.
