# Test Your Sir Terry Pratchett Knowledge

![Screenshot of the image generated in Techsini.](assets/images/stpwebsite.png)

## Purpose

This is a small website with a limited question base, however I intend to expand it as I learn about API's so I can include greater pools of questions.

The purpose of this website is to have some fun while testing your STP knowledge, using a randomiser to pick x-questions from a pool of y-questions.  At the same time not repeating any questions from the question pool.

## UX

The interface for this is a very simple multi-choice option, one answer is correct, the next button is unlocked by selecting an answer.  If the answer is correct the button will change colour to green, if the answer is incorrect the button will change to red and the correct answer will be highlighted.  You can not change your choice after selecting, as the click locks the answer and releases the 'Next' button.

## Design

For this project, I made the decision to not use any images, I made this decision based on known copyright issues with images, the estate is, understandably, quite strict about this.

The colour choices made are loosely based on Rincwind and some of his comments, but mostly based on personal choice, and trying to minimise optical issues.

## Features

As a multi-choice question based quiz the features of this site are quite minimal.  I have done this on purpose, I wanted to ensure I had a workable site that functioned the way I needed it to on the due date.  As such it is a very simple interface that allows you to enter your name, and asks 15 random questions from the available list, the questions asked are not repeated within a round, and are randomised within the list.

# Testing

## Accessibility
I have run tests checking accessibility of the site using:
***
* Screen readers - the site was readable.
* Colour blind check - the site looked good, was readable.
* Vision Imparied - the use of alt-tags and aria-labels to throughout.

## Code
I have checked the HTML using W3C HTML validator - There were no issues.

I have checked the CSS using W3C CSS validator - There were no issues.

I have checked the Javascript using the console within dev tools - There were some small bugs, all of them have been fixed.

I have tried to ensure regular commits occured and that things have been commented correctly.
